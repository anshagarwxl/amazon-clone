Amazon Clone
Welcome to my Amazon Clone project! This project was created as a learning and revision exercise, where I focused on practicing and honing my skills in HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the front-end design and layout of Amazonâ€™s homepage, providing a similar user interface experience.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structured the page content and layout.
CSS: Styled the page elements to make the design look similar to Amazon's website.

This project helped me:

Improve my HTML and CSS skills.
Learn more about responsive web design.
Practice creating clean and structured code
